*Afrolatinx and Critical DH Beyond DH* is a speace to think and discuss productive interconnection between Afrolatinx communities and digital media. Likewise, this space is open to discussions about and showcasing projects related to digital humanities from critical perspectives. The main interest of this space is to highlight projects connected to the so called "black digital humanities", paying particular attention to digital initiatives carried out by communities beyond the academe, as a way to recovery alternative ways to be human and speak back to our current algorithmic culture.
