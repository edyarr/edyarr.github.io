Afrolatinx and Critical DH Beyond DH is a speace devoted to discuss the productive interconnection between Afrolatinx communities and digital media. Likewise, we will discuss DH from critical perspectives, paying particular attention to digital initiatives carried out by communities beyond the academe, as a way to recovery alternative ways to be human and speak back to our current algorithmic culture.

## What we expect
