excerpt: "Afrolatinx, Digital Culture, Black DH"

In this talk, I will present an overviwe of my research on Afrolatinx digital culture in the Americas, emphasizing how Afrolatinx groups, collectives and communities develop digital practices that aim to create new digital worlds, intervene both the cultural and digital cultural records, affirm their humanity, and challenge contemporary algorithmic determinism that affects people's lives on and offlife.  I'll post my presentation and additional documents.
